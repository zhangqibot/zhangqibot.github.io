# About Me


Hi, I am Botter Zhang.

I am currently employed as a Deep Learning Engineer, specializing in Recommendation Systems and Information Retrieval. Lately, my interests have expanded into the field of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

I am currently affiliated with the NetEase Games team in Guangzhou. Prior to this position, I worked at [jd.com](http://jd.com/) in Beijing for about two years.

I earned my Master's degree in Meteorology from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences through joint training. During my postgraduate journey, my research primarily revolved around Arctic sea ice and its correlation with climate change. I acquired the skill to utilize AI algorithms for modeling and predicting changes in Arctic sea ice. Additionally, I was fortunate to participate in two scientific expeditions to the Arctic: one to Barrow, Alaska, and another to Greenland.

However, my career trajectory took a fascinating turn, leading me into the captivating world of AI technology instead of meteorology.

I have had the honor of winning distinguished competitions such as the WSDM CUP 2022 and KDD CUP 2022. These competitions attract the brightest minds in the field, and I learned a lot from competing alongside them. Additionally, I secured the runner-up position in the WSDM 2023 CUP, and was given the opportunity to deliver an oral presentation at the WSDM 2023 CUP in Singapore.

But my life isn't solely about codes and algorithms. My passion for landscape photography once led me to the privilege of signing contracts with Getty Images and VCG as a professional photographer. Although my photography pursuits have somewhat lessened now. 

In addition, I have a wide range of hobbies, such as playing tennis, playing soccer, playing the guitar, and playing Texas hold 'em poker with friends.

I appreciate your time in getting to know a bit about me and I'm looking forward to engaging in insightful discussions and collaborations with you.
